        <h2>Privacy Policy for Pick a Pick – AR Filter Game</h2>
        <p>Effective Date: 12/12/2024</p>
        <p>At Control Alt Experience, we are committed to protecting the privacy of users who engage with our AR filter game through our Snapchat account. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information when users interact with the filter via our account.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>1. How the Lens Works</h3>
        <p>The Pick a Pick AR filter is accessed exclusively through our Snapchat account. Users are not required to log in to their personal Snapchat accounts. All photos or interactions are performed directly through our account on a shared device we manage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
        <h4>a. User Interactions</h4>
        <p>When users engage with the AR filter, the following data is temporarily processed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fruit selection within the game.</li>
            <li>AR filter template usage (e.g., which fruit template was selected).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>b. Captured Photos or Videos</h4>
        <p>Any photos or videos taken through the AR filter are stored directly on the shared device or in our Snapchat account.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>3. How We Use the Collected Information</h3>
        <p>We use the data in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> To deliver AR templates based on the user’s fruit selection.</li>
            <li><strong>Saving Photos/Videos:</strong> Captured photos or videos may be saved temporarily on the device or shared account for display or user-requested sharing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>Since this is not a public version of the lens, we store the data and media locally and manage them exclusively. We do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Share collected data or media with third parties unless explicitly requested by the user.</li>
            <li>Integrate with external services beyond Snapchat’s platform for processing data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Photos or videos taken through the app may only be shared by our team when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users request or consent to sharing their media.</li>
            <li>It is shared directly through the Snapchat platform (e.g., Stories or Snaps).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Captured Media:</strong> Photos or videos taken through the app are stored locally on the shared device or Snapchat account and may be deleted after 48 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary Gameplay Data:</strong> Fruit selections or gameplay data are not stored permanently and are erased once the session ends.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>6. User Privacy and Consent</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Users will be informed that their interactions (e.g., fruit selection, photos, or videos) are managed by us, as the filter operates exclusively through our account.</li>
            <li>Before saving or sharing any captured media, users’ explicit consent will be obtained.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

            <li>Regular deletion of captured media that is no longer needed.</li>
